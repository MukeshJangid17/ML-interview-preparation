# Machine Learning Interview Preparation


Welcome to my Machine Learning interview preparation repository! I am currently on a journey to prepare for my dream job as a Data Scientist.
This repository contains my practice problems, solutions, and notes as I work through 250-300 machine learning questions.

Sure, here's an updated version of the "What's Inside" section with a more generalized list of topics:

## What's Inside
- **Regression:** Problems and solutions covering linear regression, polynomial regression, and other regression techniques.
- **Classification:** Questions focusing on algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
- **Clustering:** Practice problems related to clustering algorithms like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.
- **Neural Networks:** Exercises exploring feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Problems on techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).
- **Model Evaluation:** Practice questions on metrics for evaluating machine learning models, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
- **Feature Engineering:** Problems related to feature selection, feature scaling, and creating new features to improve model performance.



Feel free to browse through the repository, review the questions, and practice alongside me. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I welcome your contributions.

Letâ€™s learn and succeed together!
